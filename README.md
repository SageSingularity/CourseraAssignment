# CourseraAssignment
My project submission to the Coursera Linux Course.

To generate the `README.md` from the `makefile`, clone the repo and enter `make README.md`.
The file `guessinggame.sh` is a bash script that reads the number of files in the current directory, and then asks you to guess how many files there are. It will return "Your guess is higher", "Your guess is lower", or "Congratulations! You guessed Correctly." depending on your answer.
